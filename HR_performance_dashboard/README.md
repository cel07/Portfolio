# NYC Department of Environmental Protection Workforce Dashboards

This repository contains a PDF of sample dashboards developed during my time as a Data Analyst Intern at the NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The dashboards provide insights into workforce demographics, including gender, ethnicity, pay class status, and other key HR data. These visualizations were crucial for decision-making by the HR department and the Deputy Commissioner.

## Dashboards Included:
1. **Workforce Overview**: Provides an overview of the department's headcount by various categories, including new hires, provisional status, and managerial status.
2. **Gender and Ethnicity Breakdown**: Displays the distribution of the workforce based on gender and ethnicity.
3. **Pay Class and Salary Distribution**: A detailed visualization of workforce pay distribution across different salary bands.
4. **Retirement and Pension Status**: An analysis of retirement eligibility and pension enrollment across different age groups and years of service.

## Key Tools Used:
- **Power BI**: Used to create the dashboards and visualize workforce data.
- **Python**: Utilized for data cleaning and the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
- **Excel**: Pivot tables and statistical computations were performed using Excel.

## Data Insights:
- Provided critical insights into workforce demographics, enabling data-driven decisions on hiring, promotions, and resource allocation.
- The dashboards were presented quarterly as part of the DEP's Workforce Data Reports, helping the Deputy Commissioner of HR make informed decisions.


## About the Project:
During my internship at the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, I was responsible for generating and maintaining over 30 dashboards, which provided detailed workforce analytics. These dashboards were used by the HR department and higher management to monitor trends, ensure workforce diversity, and make strategic decisions on hiring and promotions.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **NYPD Shooting Incident Analysis (2020â€“2024)**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, GeoPandas, Folium), Quarto
   - **Description**: A comprehensive analysis of NYPD Shooting Incident Data, focusing on trends, geographic hotspots, temporal patterns, and demographic factors. This report is designed for a **non-technical audience**, with clear visualizations and actionable insights that can inform policymakers and community stakeholders.

### 2. **Credit Card Transactions Analysis**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy), Jupyter Notebook, Quarto (in progress)
   - **Description**: Analyzed **1.3M synthetic credit-card transactions** to explore customer spending behavior, detect anomalies, and surface cost-saving and risk insights. Implemented a full pipeline including data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA.  
     - Built features such as **age bands, transaction distance (Haversine), recurring spend flags, and outlier thresholds**.  
     - Conducted EDA on **monthly/quarterly trends, category spend distribution, recurring share, outliers, long-distance anomalies, and demographics (age/gender)**.  
     - Current work includes extending to **vendor consolidation scenarios, fraud modeling, and Quarto reporting**.

### 3. **Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard (Matplotlib Version)**
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: Built a dashboard for analyzing flight delay times by month, with breakdowns by carrier, weather, NAS, security, and late aircraft delays. This project highlights data preprocessing and static visualization skills. Dataset sourced from IBMâ€™s Skills Network.

### 4. **NYC Department of Environmental Protection Workforce Dashboards**
   - **Tools Used**: Power BI, Python, Excel
   - **Description**: Designed and maintained HR workforce dashboards presented quarterly to senior management. Provided insights into **gender, ethnicity, pay classes, and retirement trends** to support workforce planning and data-driven decision-making.  
   - **[View PDF of Dashboards](./HR_performance_dashboard/NYC_DEP_Workforce_Analytics.pdf)**

### 5. **Concrete Strength Prediction**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: Developed a machine learning regression model to predict compressive strength of concrete based on material composition. Demonstrates feature engineering, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling.  
   - **[View Project](./concrete_project/concrete_compressive_strength_prediction.ipynb)**

### 6. **Voting Pattern Analysis**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: Analyzed voting behavior of U.S. legislators using clustering techniques (K-Means, hierarchical clustering). Visualizations included heatmaps, t-SNE plots, and dendrograms, offering insights into legislative alignment and political patterns.  
   - **[View Project](./voting_analysis_project/voting_analysis.ipynb)**

### 7. **Kaggle Survey 2023 Dashboard (Google Looker Studio)**
   - **Tools Used**: Google Looker Studio
   - **Description**: Built an interactive dashboard analyzing the 2023 Kaggle survey. Covered **current tech usage, emerging trends, and respondent demographics**, demonstrating dashboarding and storytelling with data.

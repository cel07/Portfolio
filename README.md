# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my data analytics and data science projects, showcasing my skills in data processing, visualization, and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of the key projects included in this portfolio.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard (Matplotlib Version)**
   - **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: This project provides a dashboard for analyzing flight delay times by month for a specified year. Utilizing Matplotlib for static visualization, it allows the examination of multiple delay types, including carrier, weather, NAS, security, and late aircraft delays. The dataset is sourced from IBM's Skills Network, and the notebook enables users to filter and visualize delay trends over time.

### 2. **NYC Department of Environmental Protection Workforce Dashboards**
   - **Tools Used**: Power BI, Python, Excel
   - **Description**: Created and maintained workforce dashboards for the HR department, offering insights into gender, ethnicity, pay classes, and retirement statuses. These dashboards were presented quarterly to assist senior management in making data-driven decisions.

### 3. **Concrete Strength Prediction**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: Developed a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete using a dataset of material compositions. This project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

### 4. **Voting Pattern Analysis**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: Analyzed the voting patterns of U.S. legislators using clustering techniques such as K-Means and hierarchical clustering. This project provides insights into how legislators from different districts vote on key bills, visualizing the results through heatmaps, t-SNE plots, and dendrograms.

### 5. **Kaggle Survey 2023 Dashboard (Google Looker Studio)**
   - **Tools Used**: Google Looker Studio
   - **Description**: Created a comprehensive dashboard using the 2023 Kaggle survey data, analyzing current technology usage, future technology trends, and respondent demographics. This dashboard provides insights into both the current and future technology preferences among survey respondents, along with demographic breakdowns.

# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my data analytics and data science projects, showcasing my skills in data processing, visualization, and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of the key projects included in this portfolio.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **NYC Department of Environmental Protection Workforce Dashboards**
   - **Tools Used**: Power BI, Python, Excel
   - **Description**: Created and maintained workforce dashboards for the HR department, offering insights into gender, ethnicity, pay classes, and retirement statuses. These dashboards were presented quarterly to assist senior management in making data-driven decisions.

### 2. **Concrete Strength Prediction**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: Developed a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete using a dataset of material compositions. This project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

### 3. **Synthetic Dataset Clustering**
   - **Tools Used**: Python (Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook
   - **Description**: Applied K-Means clustering to synthetic datasets (e.g., blobs, moons) to analyze how different configurations impact clustering performance. This project highlights my ability to implement and evaluate clustering algorithms.
